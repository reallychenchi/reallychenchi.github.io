(CNN) -- The Israel Defense Forces called off a raid after one of its combat soldiers posted information about the operation, including the time and place, on Facebook, the IDF said Wednesday.

"On Wednesday, we are cleaning up (the village). Today - arrest. On Thursday, God willing, we will be home," the soldier, who was not identified, posted on the social networking site, according to IDF.

The post was removed after other soldiers in the company saw it online and reported it to their commanders, IDF said.

"The division commander decided to cancel the operation out of concern that the information had reached hostile groups and would harm IDF forces," it said.

The soldier was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment and was removed from his battalion and all combat postings, IDF said. His combat certificate also was revoked.

IDF soldiers are prohibited from posting classified information online, including photographs of military interests.

　　以色列国防军发言人周三声称，国防军叫停了一个搜捕行动，因为该行动的一名士兵把包括时间地点在内的搜捕行动的信息贴到了开心网上。

　　“在周三，我们要去清扫（村庄）。今天，逮捕。周四，老天开眼，回家。”国防军认为这名士兵把未许可的信息发布到了社交网站上。

　　和这名士兵同一个连队的战友发现了这个帖子并且报告了连指导员，国防军发言人说，然后删帖了。

　　“考虑到这些信息可能被恐怖组织接触到并由此对我军造成伤害，师政委决定取消搜捕行动”，发言人说。

　　这名士兵被处以十天禁闭，赶出军营，档案删除所有战斗记录，发言人说，并且，他的战斗许可也被吊销（开除军籍？）。

　　以色列国防军的士兵是禁止把内部信息发布到网上的，包括军事图片。
