Good news for us all:http://tech.163.com/08/1015/04/4O93IQTP000915BD.html

If so, I will turned to Linux immediately, now Linux is powerful enough to meet most of usage now. We can use QQ to chating in Linux, use Firefox to view web in Linux, also send and receive e-mails in Linux, enjoy music in Linux, watch movie in Linux. Surely, we can programming in Linux, and in Linux there is a much large space for us to programming. En, but please do not ask me the reason why still using Windows.

The only bad news is that we can not use msn in Linux, do you care?

Enjoy Linux, this is just what MS want us to.
